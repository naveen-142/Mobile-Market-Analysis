# 📊 Mobile Market Analysis using Web Scraping & Data Analytics

## 🧠 Overview

This project is my **first end-to-end Data Analytics project**, where I used **Selenium** to scrape mobile phone data from **Flipkart**, cleaned and validated the dataset using **Pandas**, and visualized key business insights using **Matplotlib**.

The goal was to extract meaningful patterns from real-world e-commerce data and present them in a visually compelling format to demonstrate my understanding of data collection, preparation, and analysis.
